# DevoTeam-FE-test

*This is FE test for DevoTeam.*

[deployed link - live](https://devoteam-fe-test-shan.vercel.app)

- run `yarn` to install all needed packages first
- run `yarn start` to start app
- run `yarn test` to run unit test

Features (mandatory & extraðŸŒŸ)

1. âœ… Fetch data from api, by default, it will render the list view. Results are sorted by asc by default.
2. âœ… If you click the sort-icon, results will be sorted by desc and the icon will also change to a different one to indicate that.
3. âœ… If you click view-switch-icon, you will toggle between list-view and thumnail-cards-view. Again, the icon will change correspondingly.
4. âœ… If you type anything, search results will update.
5. ðŸŒŸ Add clear input button.
6. ðŸŒŸ When there is no search result, show some text to let the user know, instead of a blank page.
7. ðŸŒŸ When there is an error (when fetching data from api), the user will see an error page with error message there.
8. âœ… Two different layout will be responsive, to implement that, I used both grid and flex.
9. âœ… Follow design, use correct font-family and etc.
10. âœ… Add unit test for all functionality
11. ðŸŒŸ Add basic skeleton while loading

Can be improved/discussed:

1. Can store results in sessionStorage when we fetch data for the first time to avoid sending multiple requests when we refresh the page;
2. Can add more hover/fancy effect to desktop version;
3. Title's position on desktop and how it should look like on medium size screen, I made some tiny adjustment.
4. Can add more accessibility later on
